Suppose that I am a data analyst at one of the fast growing e-commerce in Brazil, Samba-Commerce. In order to support the company growth as well as provide more comprehensive and insightful information, the CEO ask me to create company wide dashboard

I applied cross filtering and blend data from different data sources. As a result, the users could interact with one chart and apply that interaction as a filter to other charts in the report.

I've summarize the key insight from the data. Those are :
1. Event though our business is still relatively new, but we already have more than **1.7K** sellers and **48K** customers who made **49.490** orders with total payment of **7,8M**. This facts clearly tell us that we experienced significant growth in our business
2. Overall, our customers are most likely to buy products under **Bed Table Bath**, Sport Leisure, Health Beauty, Furniture Decpration, and Computer Categpry. So, we can provide discount or other offer that attract customer to purchase one of these categories
3. Our customer total payment in order mostly ranged from 51K-200K
4. Sao Paolo (SP) is state with the most customers and highest revenue. SP has significant different from other state
5. Our customer are most likely to use credit card for their payment

I also provide some reccomendations. Those are :
1. We have research and ask product team the reason why Bed Table Bath can reach the highest order with significant difference to another categories in order to remake that strategis for other products.
2. We should expand our area of promotion in order to reach prospective customers. So Our brand awarenes are more evenly distributed in all Brazil state, not only SP
